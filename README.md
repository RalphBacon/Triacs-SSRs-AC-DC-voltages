# Triacs, SSRs, AC & DC voltages
So what's the difference between a TRIAC and an SSR? And do they all work on AC or some on DC?

A TRIAC (TRIode for AC) is a semiconductor switch that can operate on household AC voltages (some industrial version can handle well above that and some are suitable for lower voltages too) to switch things on and off. Lights, TVs, heaters... the list goes on.

But I didn't use a Triac in a recent project to switch on a low current motor. Why not? What was the downside of doing so? And what's all this about a Solid State Relay (SSR) being safer than a TRIAC? 

We explore the reasons for my decision (safety first, as it happens) and do a couple of experiments with a very small TRIAC that can still pass 1.5A - certainly sufficient for a small motor that only draws 4 Watts in power. But to keep safe I'm using an isolation transformer and a low voltage. I have no desire to become sizzling Bacon!

I've added a PDF or two to my Github (as well as repeating this description) as they make for interesting reading.
